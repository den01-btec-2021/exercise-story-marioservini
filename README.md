# Exercise 1.9 - Story 

Write a program that asks the user for a character's name and their job. The program then prints a short story.

The output must be as shown below -- note, the name and job depend on the user's input.

```plaintext
I will tell you a story, but I need some information first.
What is the main character called?
*Bob*
What is their job?
*a builder*
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was Bob, who was a builder.
On the way to work, Bob reflected on life.
Perhaps Bob will not be a builder forever.
```

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
def story():
    # Write your code here
    
story()
```

Here's another example output:

```plaintext
I will tell you a story, but I need some information first.
What is the main character called?
*Ada*
What is their job?
*a Data scientist*
Here is the story:
Once upon a time there was Ada, who was a Data scientist.
On the way to work, Ada reflected on life.
Perhaps Ada will not be a Data scientist forever.
```
